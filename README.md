# 💼 Salary Prediction using Linear Regression


````markdown

This project uses a simple **Linear Regression** model to predict salaries based on years of experience. It's a beginner-friendly implementation using `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset typically contains two columns:
- `YearsExperience`: Number of years of professional experience
- `Salary`: Corresponding salary

---

## 📦 Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/salary-prediction-ml.git
   cd salary-prediction-ml
   ```
2. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook salary-prediction.ipynb
   ```

## 🧠 Model Used

* **Linear Regression** from `sklearn.linear_model`
* Trained on a dataset mapping experience to salary
* Predictions are made on unseen data for testing

---

## 🔍 Workflow

* 📥 Load the dataset
* 📊 Visualize data using scatter plots
* 🔢 Train a Linear Regression model
* 🎯 Predict salary based on input experience
* 📈 Plot regression line

---

## 📈 Sample Output

```python
model.predict([[5]])  # Predict salary for 5 years of experience
```

---

## ✅ Results

* The model fits a best-fit line to historical data
* Can predict approximate salary for a given experience level
* Great demo of supervised regression
